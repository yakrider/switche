## Config settings file for Switche appliation .. uses toml format
# (Note that in toml format, root keys must be listed before any tables with square-brackets are started)
#
# The application will look for this file (switche.conf.toml) in the same directory from which it is running (if the location is writeable)
# If that location is not writeable, the config file will pick  ~/AppData/Local/Switche/ as conf file location
# Upon startup, if the conf file is not present in the location selected as above, a default conf file will be created in that location
# Configurations modified at run time (e.g. window size/position etc) will be written back to this file
# Most changes to this file (unless specified in the config) will be picked up by the application upon reload or restart


# Enable auto-hide of switche window upon losing focus .. default is true

# Enable switche to replace windows task-switcher upon alt-tab press .. default is true
# Note this this will install a lower-level keyboard hook to intercept alt-tab presses
# Also note that when not running elevated/as-admin, hooks can miss key events while elevated windows are foreground ..
# .. this can lead to unexpected behavior. As such, it is recommended to run switche elevated/as-admin if this is enabled

# Configuration for optional user-specifiable hotkeys to directly switch to specific app (if present at the time)
# Each entry can be listed under [[flex_hotkey]] table heading, and must have a 'hotkey' specified
# The optional 'exe' field is the executable name (without the path) of the app to switch to
# The optional 'title' field is the window-title of the app to switch to (if present)
# The hotkey will toggle between the cur window and the first not-currently-top window matching the specs (if any)
